# MyGov India: An 11-Year Journey of Citizen Power

This is an interactive timeline celebrating the 11th anniversary of **MyGov India**, the world's largest citizen engagement platform. This personal project visualizes the incredible journey of MyGov from its inception in 2014 to its current status as a cornerstone of digital democracy in India.

The core idea behind this project was to showcase the power of participatory governance. When citizens and government collaborate, it creates a powerful force for positive change. This timeline highlights key milestones where citizen ideas and participation have shaped national policies, driven social movements, and supported the nation during critical times.
